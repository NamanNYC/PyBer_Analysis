# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this particular analysis is to acknowledge and bring attention to any differences in the ride-sharing data between any of the city types. This happens through the use of our skills in Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create a graph to easily show the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results
### 1st image
From the following attached image, we can infer that as we read the data starting from Rural cities to Urban, the Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares increase, with Rural having the least amount of Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares and Urban having the most amount. Moving along to Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver, we can infer the opposite occurring. The Rural cities see the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, whereas the Urban cities see the lowest averages for both Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver.

### 2nd image
We can see from the following attached image that in the span of 9 weeks, the Rural city type has consistently seen a relatively lower sum of fares for each week, while the Urban city type has a relatively higher sum of fares for each week.

## Summary
### First Business Recommendation
Increase marketing capacity in Rural areas to make up for expenditure versus revenue discrepancy.
### Second Business Recommendation 
Recruit more drivers for the Suburban city type as there seems to be somewhat of a vacancy in drivers leading to a decrease in revenue. The difference in fare prices between Rural and Suburban is approximately $15,000 and the difference in fare prices between Suburban and Urban is approximately $20,000. This could be made up simply by increasing the amount of drivers in the Suburban city type. 
### Third Business Recommendation
Increase fare price for Urban and decrease fare price for Rural city types to get more close together so prices are evenly distrubuted between each city type, increasing profits and not executing significant and noticeable change in price. Plus, if future increase of fares occurs, that will also almost go unnoticed.
